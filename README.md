1. Web Scraper Setup:

   - Choose a programming language for your web scraper, such as Python with libraries like BeautifulSoup or Selenium.
   - Identify the target bank's website and the specific pages from which you want to scrape data.
   - Use web scraping techniques to extract relevant data, such as account balances, recent transactions, and interest rates.

2. Data Parsing and Processing:

   - Clean and format the scraped data to make it more readable and organized.
   - Calculate important metrics, such as total balance, average transaction amount, and spending trends.

3. WhatsApp Integration:

   - Use a messaging API to connect your application to WhatsApp. Twilio or the official WhatsApp Business API can be useful for this purpose.
   - Set up the necessary credentials and authentication for sending messages through WhatsApp.

4. Automation and Scheduling:

   - Implement a scheduling mechanism using libraries like schedule in Python or a task scheduler on your operating system.
   - Configure the scraper to run daily at a specific time to fetch the latest data from the bank's website.

5. Message Generation:

   - Craft informative and concise messages that include the relevant financial data.
   - Include a summary of the account balances, recent transactions, and any significant changes since the last update.

6. Error Handling and Notifications:

   - Implement error handling mechanisms to deal with issues like website changes, server errors, or connectivity problems.
   - Set up notifications, such as email alerts, in case the scraper encounters errors or fails to retrieve data.

7. Security and Privacy:

   - Ensure that sensitive data, like login credentials and scraped information, are stored securely and encrypted.
   - Follow best practices for handling user data to maintain privacy and compliance.

8. Customization and User Preferences:

   - Allow users to customize the types of data they want to receive via WhatsApp messages.
   - Provide options to select the frequency of updates (daily, weekly, etc.) and the specific accounts to monitor.

9. User Authentication:

   - Implement user authentication to ensure that only authorized individuals can access their financial data.
   - Use secure authentication methods like OAuth or two-factor authentication.

10. User-Friendly Interface:
    - Develop a simple web interface or command-line interface (CLI) for users to set up and manage their scraping preferences.
